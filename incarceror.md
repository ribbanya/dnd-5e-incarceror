# The Incarceror 


Rain falls through the leaves on the boy who refuses to abandon his home. Scars of abuse cover his face. But today the very demon sealed in his belly, the focus of the town's hate, will be used to save the village that shunned him.

A shrine maiden's tears boil away on her glowing cheeks. The temple stands in ruins around her, the priest that raised her lies expiring beneath the rubble of her home. The temple’s patron celestial now sits enthroned at the palace of her soul demanding vengeance against the empire that raises its earthly see.

Crawling through the wasteland irradiated by magics best forgotten, a boy screams in pain as his body mutates around him. The Abomination within the world egg, awakened by the falling bombs, has found a host.  The boy fights to control the eldritch energies coursing through him and not be lost in the Abomination’s extra-dimensional mind.

A farmhand looks out over a frozen valley, wondering if he really has a choice on this grand adventure or if he is simply just a new shell for the voice in his head. Will he even be himself at the end of this? Or does every step just bring him closer to being assimilated into the ancient, reincarnating wizard who intends to kill Death?

All of these are Incarcerors. Incarcerors have great power, but it is not their own. They instead draw upon the unearthly entities sealed inside them. Where gods give their clerics and paladins powers, warlocks receive their gifts through a mystic contract with their patrons, and Sorcerers ignite the powers coursing through their bloodlines, Incarcerors usually must take their powers by guile or force from entities sealed within their body. Rarely are such entities willing to part with their power, especially to mere mortals. Drawing on these powers can cause immense strain on the body. Incarcerors must train their body to become accustomed to otherworldly energies flowing through them. Sometimes, even pushing beyond their limits. 

An Incarerors presence looms large over battlefields and can turn the tide of a fight. But they must be ever cautious not to draw on too much of their tenant's strength lest they become corrupted by its influence and turn against their allies, or worse let it escape.

### Accursed Vessels

Mortals are often apprehensive around Incarcerors, as they are never quite sure if the person looking out from those eyes is their friend or a terrible creature trying to get free. Fear often leads to hate so if their identity becomes know Incarceror’s are magnets for discrimination. All kinds of evils and misfortunes are blamed on them and the entities sealed inside them.

### Creating an Incarceror

Becoming an Incarceror is something that happens to you. Every Incarceror has a story about how they came to contain a being of immense power, and it is often a story of great loss. When making an Incarceror, consider how the events that lead up to imprisoning your Sealed Entity have affected you and it.

An Incarceror’s relationship with their entity is almost always the defining relationship in their life. Sealed Entities are rarely pleased with their situation and often resent their jailors. While almost all Sealed Entities wouldn’t hesitate to be free of their prison, they are creatures of immense power with goals of their own. Sometimes they will agree to help their Incarceror or even prolong their imprisonment if it suits their interests

### Accursed Cloak 
Incareror’s can tap into the well of power that is sealed within their bodies to empower themselves while fighting. However, doing so exposes their mind to the corrupting influence of the entity sealed inside them. As a bonus action, you may activate your Accursed Cloak, when you do so you gain temporary hit points equal to your **Accursed Cloak Capacity.** 

At the beginning of every turn that your Accursed Cloak is active, if you have fewer temporary hit points than your **Accursed Cloak Capacity** you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency modifier. These temporary hit points add together with any temporary hit points you still have from this feature up to a maximum of your **Accursed Cloak Capacity.**  You may dismiss your Accursed Cloak as a free action and you loose all temporary hit points when your Accursed Cloak is dismissed. 

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>
 
 <font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **Accursed Cloak Capacity** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> your Proficiency modifier + half your Incarceror level(rounded up)
 
 </center>
 
 </font>

You may activate your Accursed Cloak a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier(minimum 1). You regain all uses of your Accursed Cloak when you finish a short rest.



### Corruption

Starting at 1st level, at the end of a turn that your Accursed Cloak is active roll a d20. If the result of the the roll is less than or equal to your *Corruption Threshold* the entity immediately takes one of the actions on the Sealed Entity Actions Table at the end of this class.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>
 
 <font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **Corruption Threshold** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> 1 + number of Burned Channeling Dice + additions made by other features
 
 </center>
 
 </font>
 
> DM’s, when not in combat have the player roll their Corruption Check after they do any action or benefit from an effect of their Accursed Cloak.

### Sealed Entity

Every Incarceror carries within them a tremendously powerful entity. Choose one of the following Sealed Entities: the Aberration, the Archangel, the Archfey, the Archfiend, or  the Archwizard, the Ancient Dragon, the Ancient Lich, or the Ageless Tarrasque each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 20th levels.

### Channeling
Starting at 2nd level you gain access to the well of power that your Seal Entity has. You gain a number of d4 detailed in the Incarceror Table above. These dice can be used for several of your Incarceror features.

Additionally some features will allow you to **Burn** Channeling Dice for additional effects. Burned dice can no longer be used as part of any feature. You regain all Burned die at the end of a long rest. 

### Channeling Attack

The energies of your sealed entity are often corrosive to others. At 2nd level while your Accursed Cloak is active, once during your turn when you make an attack you may choose to roll any number of unburned Channeling Dice and add the result to the damage of the attack. Increase your *Corruption Threshold* for this turn by 1 for each die that you rolled. You may not dismiss your Accursed Cloak on the same turn that you use this feature.

### Channeling Magic
Starting at 2nd level you gain the ability to cast spells.
The Incarceror casts spells by channeling the power of their Sealed Entity through their bodies.
Since your magic relies on your body to withstand the strain of channeling your Seal Entity’s power, Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your Incarceror spells and features.

#### Spellcasting Focus
 Your body acts as a spellcasting focus for your Incarceror spells and features.

\pagebreak

#### Spell Slots

 The Incareror table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, when you are 5th level you have one 1st level spell slot and one 2nd level spell slot.

#### Spells known of 1st Level and Higher

You know one 1st level spell of your choice from the Incarceror spell list or your Sealed Entity’s spell list. The Channeling Spells column of the Incarceror table shows when you learn more Incarceror spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach your 6th level in this class you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Incarceror spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Incarceror spell list or your Seal Entity's spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Risky Power

Channeling the powers of your Sealed Entity to cast spells exposes your body to their influence. When you a cast a spell using an Incarceror Spell slot or Manifestation, increase your *Corruption Threshold* for this turn by the level of the spell, if your Accursed Cloak is not active make a Corruption Check after you cast the spell.


#### Overdraft
You may cast an Incarceror spell even if you have expended all your spell slots of its level by Burning a number of Channeling Dice equal to the level of the spell slot.

### Manifestations

 As your body learns to handle the energies of your Sealed Entity you gain the ability to manifest some of their abilities. At 3rd level, you gain two Manifestations of your choice from the General Manifestation list or your Sealed Entity’s Manifestation list. When you gain certain Incarceror levels you gain additional powers of your choice, as shown in the Manifestations column of the Incarceror Table above. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the powers you know and replace it with another power that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in a power’s description refers to your Incarceror level, not your character level. 

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

### Residual Energies
As you repeatedly Channel your Sealed Entity vestiges of its power remain in your body. As it builds up you can learn to control it, assuming a fraction of your Entity's power as your own.  Beginning at 5th level when you make a melee attack you deal an aditional amount of damage equal to the number of Channeling Dice you have burned.

\columnbreak



### Harmony / Domination

As you grow in power, your relationship with the entity sealed within has a major impact on the way you manifest its power. At 6th level, you gain one of the following benefits depending on your relationship with your sealed entity. When you level up you may change with the benefit you gain if your relationship with your sealed entity has shifted.

* ***Harmony:*** When you fail your Corruption Check you may roll twice on the Entity Actions Table and choose which action it takes. You may do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses after you complete a long rest.
* ***Domination:*** When you use your Channeling Attack feature you may reroll a number of Channeling Dice up to your Charisma modifier. You may do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses after you complete a long rest.

At 15th level, you gain an additional benefit depending on your relationship with your Sealed Entity.

* ***Harmony:*** You regain 1/2 of your Burned Channeling Dice after you complete a short rest.
* ***Domination:*** When you roll a Channeling Die treat all 1s rolled as 2s. You have disadvantage on Corruption Check rolls. 

### Legendary Resilience
 The strain that channeling energies that the mortal body was not meant to handle causes it to change and adapt in subtle ways. A body’s natural defenses soon learn to neutralize and purify the corrupting energies leaking from the seal inside you and in moments of great peril the body might draw on those energies to accomplish astounding feats of strength or intellect. At 11th level when you fail a saving throw or your Corruption Check you may choose to reroll and use the new result. You may only use this feature once per long rest, regaining all expended uses after you complete a long rest. 
 
 You gain an additional use of this feature at 18th level.


> ##### Breaking the Seal
>  For players that are comfortable with it you may consider changing the consequence of failing 3 death saves as the Sealed Entity taking full control of your body or being unleashed back into the world.

## The Aberration
The ancient twisting mind of a monstrosity from beyond the stars slumbers inside your body. It may have been sealed away by meager men to contain its corrupting influence; or perhaps you are the vessel chosen by its secretive cult incubating their master as they prepare for its arrival; either way the machinations of mere mortals are not enough to confine it. Its foul tongue haunts your nightmares, opening your eyes to new dimensions and growing new limbs hidden therein.

#### Aberration Entity Spell List
| Level| Spells |
|:---:|:-------:|
|  1  | Arms of Hadar, Command, Ray of Sickness|
|  2  |  Detect Thoughts, Ray of Enfeeblement, Suggestion |
|  3  | Blink, Enemies Abound, Hunger of Hadar |
|  4  |  Compulsion, Confusion, Evard’s Black Tentacles |
|  5  | Dominate Person, Geas, Telepathic Bond |

#### A Mind from Beyond the Stars
At 1st level, you can glimpse into the mind and memory of the Aberration sealed inside you. 

When you complete a long rest you may choose either Arcana or History, you gain proficiency in that skill. Further, when you make an ability check that uses your Arcana or History proficiency you may roll a Channeling Die, adding the result to the ability check. Finally, you can speak and read Deep Speech. 

#### Aberrant Flesh

At 1st level, while your Accursed Cloak is active your eyes become covered with a yellow film, and your skin shifts to a sickly grey and moves as if there were thousands of worms wiggling just underneath its surface. As you channel your entity your body moves erratically in strange directions beyond the normal ones you are used to. 

In this form, you gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to grapple a creature or escape a grapple, while you are grappled with a creature you may make a melee attack against the creature as a bonus action; this attack deals an additional 1d4 psychic damage. 

Additionally, you may choose to make the damage you deal with your Channeling Attack feature psychic damage.

#### Non-Euclidean Body

Starting at 6th Level, you can manifest limbs hidden in other dimensions. 

While your Accursed Cloak is active as a bonus action you manifest a 10 ft long tentacle from a space you can see within 10 feet. The tentacle counts as an extension of yourself, it uses your armor class and any damage dealt to it is subtracted from your hit points. As part of the bonus action used to manifest the tentacle, you may make an unarmed attack or attempt to grapple a creature within range of the tentacle.

\pagebreak

As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you may move the tentacle up to 15 feet and make another unarmed attack or attempt to grapple. The tentacle lasts until you manifest another tentacle or dismiss your Accursed Cloak. You may use this a number of times up to your constitution modifier until you complete a long rest. 


Additionally, your unarmed attacks are considered magic for the purpose of overcoming resistance. 


#### Non-Euclidean Mind
At 10th level, you may use an action to end the charmed or frightened condition. 

#### Maddening Form
At 14th Level, so much power from the Aberration is flowing through you that it becomes corrosive to the mind to stand in your presence. While your Accursed Cloak is active, when a creature starts their turn within 5 feet of you, or when they enter that range, they must make an Intelligence Saving throw. If they fail they gain a short-term madness effect as described in the DMG for the next 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds on their saving throw or recovers from their short term madness is immune to this effect for 24 hours. 

#### Unleash the Horror
At 20th Level your mind and body have adapted to the extra-dimensional energies you can approach the source of your power. For a short while you can release the seal containing the Old God within you and use its raw powers for yourself. You and your sealed entity make work in harmony or you may forcibly wield its powers for yourself. Once per long rest you gain one of the following features, depending on your relationship with your Sealed Entity.

***Harmony:*** As a bonus action while your Accursed Cloak is active you may release the seal that restricts your Sealed Entity. For the next minute you gain the following benefits:
* Your creature type is now Aberration
* At the beginning of your turn you regain 1 burned channeling die
* You gain a +2 bonus to one of your Ability scores
* You may Search as a bonus action or reaction once per round

***Domination:*** As an action while your Accursed Cloak is active you may release the seal that restricts your Sealed Entity. You transform into an Aberration of CR 16 or lower. While transformed you must still make your Corruption Check. If you fail, roll twice for on the Sealed Entity Action Table and do both actions.

## The Archangel
The burning light of a divine warrior is contained within your body. It may have been shackled by upstart mortals who wished to use its power as a ferocious weapon in their wars on the material plane, by dark forces who wish to deprive the gods of one of their greatest defenders, or by the gods themselves for some ineffable purpose here below. Regardless, it is impossible to fully conceal the radiance of the Celestial. The presence of such a pure being consecrated you, making you a great boon to allies and a bane to your enemies. 

#### Archangel Entity Spell List
| Level| Spells |
|:---:|:-------:|
|  1  | Bless, Cure Wounds, Protection from Evil and Good, Sanctuary, Shield of Faith|
|  2  |Lesser Restoration,See Invisibility, Spiritual Weapon|
|  3  |Crusader’s Mantle, Mass Healing Word, Revivify, Spirit Guardians|
|  4  |Guardian of Faith|
|  5  |Dispel Evil and Good, Circle of Power|

#### Celestial Mind
At 1st level, you can hear the whispers of the heavenly mind dwelling within you. 

When you complete a long rest you may choose either Religion or History, you gain proficiency in that skill until your next long rest. Further, when you make an ability check that uses your Religion of History proficiency you may roll a channeling die and add the result to the ability check. 

Finally, you can speak and read celestial. 


#### Leaking Radiance

At 1st level, while your Accursed Cloak is active your eyes glow with soft golden light, shining glyphs appear across your skin, and a thin halo made of dust from the environment forms above your head. As you channel your entity your hair and clothes swirl around you as if they were submerged in water or blown by a gentle breeze. 

In this form, you may release a damaging bolt of light at your enemies. You may use an action to make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 60ft; this attack deals 2d4 radiant damage. You may apply your Channeling Attack feature to this attack. 

Additionally, you may choose to make the damage you deal with your Channeling Attack feature radiant damage. 


#### Celestial Infusion
At 6th level, the celestial energies coursing through your veins is potent enough to enervate yourself and others. 

While your Accursed Cloak is active you may use an action to heal yourself or a creature you can touch; roll any number of unburned Channeling Dice, the chosen creature regains hit points equal to the result. Increase your *Corruption Threshold* for this turn by 1 for each die rolled. You may use this a number of times up to your constitution modifier until you complete a long rest.  

\pagebreak

#### Lesser Magic Resistance
At 10th level when a magical effect would force you to make a saving throw you may roll a Channeling Die and add the result to the saving throw. 


#### Searing Brilliance
At 14th level, you can release the pure energies as a flash of light so bright that it burns to look at you. While your Accursed Cloak is active you shed 10 feet of bright light and 10 feet of dim light beyond that. Additionally, while your Accursed Cloak is active when you are targeted by an attack or spell you may use your reaction to force the creature targeting you to make a Wisdom Saving Throw, if they fail they become blind until the end of their next turn, on a success they make any attack rolls against you at disadvantage until the end of their turn. 

\columnbreak


#### Open the Heavens
At 20th Level your mind and body are pure enough you may wield the raw devine energy of your Sealed Entity. For a moment you can unchain the angel inside of you and take its weapons as your own. You and your sealed entity may work in harmony or you may forcibly wield its powers for yourself. Once per long rest you gain one of the following features, depending on your relationship with your Sealed Entity.


***Harmony:*** As a bonus action while your Accursed Cloak is active you may release the seal that restricts your Sealed Entity. For the next minute you gain the following benefits:
* Your creature type is now Celestial
* At the beginning of your turn you regain 1 burned channeling die
* You gain a +2 bonus to one of your Ability scores
* Once per round as a reaction to a creature taking damage you may heal them by 1d4 hit points. 

***Domination:*** As an action while your Accursed Cloak is active you may release the seal that restricts your Sealed Entity. You transform into an Celestial of CR 16 or lower.

## The Archfey
The twisting capricious of the Archfey struggles against the shackles of the seal upon your form. It may have been duped into this arrangement by one of its rivals in the courts of the Feywild, or placed inside you by a god that it crossed, or you might be the latest in your lineage to bear the responsibility of a deal made so long ago that it is now called a curse; however, none of these are enough to keep the Archfey from its mischief. It will require great wit, but the razor edge can be walked to direct your tenant's beguiling magic to your own ends. 

#### Archfey Entity Spell List
| Level| Spells |
|:---:|:-------:|
|  1  |Charm Person,  Faerie Fire, Sleep|

At 1st level, while your Accursed Cloak is active your eyes sparkle like gems, changing color according to your mood, and you move with otherworldly grace. As you channel your entity a strange aroma like wildflowers or the depths of the forests suffuses the air around you. 

In this form, you may use a bonus action to force a creature to make a Wisdom Saving Throw, if they fail they become charmed by you until the end of their next turn. When the creature takes damage they may reattempt the saving throw to end the effect. 

Additionally, while your Accursed Cloak is active you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed. 


#### Fairy Crown
At 6th level, while your Accursed Cloak is active you appear to be clothed in a strange hyper-vibrant finary and a delicate crown of flowers appears on your brow. 

As a bonus action, you can issue a one-word command to a creature you have charmed, during their next turn, if they are still charmed by you, they will attempt to carry out the instruction to the best of their ability; they will not follow a command that is directly harmful to it or if they do not understand the language you speak it in. You may use this a number of times up to your constitution modifier until you complete a long rest.

## The Archfiend
The fiendish authority of a Prince of Hell or an Abyssal Lord seethes within their prison, cursing their jailer: you. An exorcism may have freed you from their possession and sealed them inside you, you may be the container for a demonic sect waiting for their patron to bring about the end of the world, or you may contain a secret weapon in the Blood War hidden away so that the other side never discovers you; regardless of how the Dark One has come to dwell inside you it will not betray its nature.

## Sealed Entity: The Archwizard

>***Magic Resistance.*** The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
>***Reflective Carapace.*** Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.
>
>***Siege Monster.*** The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claws, one with its horns or with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.
>
>***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: (2d12 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can't bite another target
>
>***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: (2d8 + 6) slashing damage.
>
>***Horns.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.
>
>***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone
>
>***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 60 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
>***Swallow.*** The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 28 (8d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns. If the tarrasque takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.
